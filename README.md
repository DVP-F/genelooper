Phase 1: Creature Engine

Generate creatures as ASCII strings

Assign traits (length, symmetry, aggression, etc.)

Mutation + crossover logic

Phase 2: Evolution Loop

Survivors breed

Each loop improves the population

Save population state in a file (memory.txt)

Phase 3: Game World

Add interactive player decisions

Player actions affect survival indirectly (e.g., “feed”, “isolate”, “burn corrupted gene”)

Phase 4: Loop Mechanics

Reset game state except creatures

Possibly add fake "error logs" or "glitches" as part of loop-breaking

Phase 5: Hidden Ending

Certain combinations (like genetic sequences) start breaking the loop

Glitched visuals or messages appear

Eventually: you escape (or die forever trying)
